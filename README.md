# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis using Machine Learning

This project aims to analyze and predict student academic performance based on various behavioral and academic factors.  
By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, the project explores key attributes that influence students’ grades and learning outcomes.

---

## 📁 Project Overview
The dataset contains student-related information such as age, study hours, attendance, scholarship, extracurricular activities, and more.  
The goal is to uncover patterns affecting performance and build a classification model to predict students’ grades.

---

## 🧩 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset for accurate analysis.
- Explore relationships between features using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Apply machine learning algorithms to predict student performance.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and classification metrics.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Feature-engine**

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values with `SimpleImputer`
   - Treat outliers using `Winsorizer`
   - Encode categorical variables (`LabelEncoder`, `OrdinalEncoder`, `OneHotEncoder`)
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize feature distributions and correlations
   - Analyze categorical variables (attendance, scholarship, sports activity)
3. **Model Building**
   - Trained models: Random Forest Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
4. **Evaluation**
   - Model accuracy and classification report

## 📈 Results
- Developed a predictive model that classifies student grade outcomes based on multiple academic and behavioral features.  
- Insights can help educators and institutions identify factors impacting academic success and improve student engagement strategies.

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Higher study hours and class attendance are strongly correlated with better grades.
- Students with scholarships tend to maintain consistent performance.
- Extracurricular involvement may affect study hours but not always negatively impact grades.
